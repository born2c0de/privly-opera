h1. The Privly Opera Extension

Opera handles extensions in a much different way than Firefox and Chrome. This document details the differences and other information that might be useful.

h2. How To Use The Opera Extension

Once the extension has reached the same level of maturity as the Firefox and Chrome extensions, I'll submit it to the "Opera Extensions Catalog":https://addons.opera.com/en/addons/extensions/.

However, to try it out in "developer mode", just download the source and drag the config.xml file into the Opera browser to install it.

h2. Caveats
* No Context Menu API
** It is impossible to extend Opera's context menu in versions 11.x and below. However, Opera devs have promised a Context Menu API for Opera 12.
* No Cross-Origin Web Requests
** This is most probably a bug as Opera does allow the "access tag":http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/extensions-api-config-access/ in the extension's config file.
** A current workaround is to either use JSONP (which is not currently supported by Privly) or a jQuery Hack ( $.support.cors = true; )
* No direct access of child objects of the window object.
** All child objects (location, XPathResult, addEventHandler) need to be prefixed with 'window'. (window.location, window.XPathResult, window.addEventHandler)
* Opera hates bad code
** Most Javascript errors cause the extension to stop working. For example, in the resizeIframe function in privly.js, a string is expected. However, a MessageType object is also sent once by the browser. Other browsers ignore the error caused by attempting a split() on an Object but Opera doesn't like it at all.
